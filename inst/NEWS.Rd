generated report files. PathoStat provides various functionalities including 
Relative Abundance charts, Diversity estimates and plots, tests of Differential 
Abundance, Time Series visualization, and Core OTU analysis. The package 
includes the following features.
    \itemize{
        \item Relative Abundance plots (Stacked Bar Plot, Heatmap)
        \item Diversity plots (Alpha and Beta diversity, Exploratory Tree, 
            BiPlot, Co-Occurrence)
        \item Differential Expression (Expression Plots, Limma)
        \item Confidence Region Plots
        \item PCA plots
        \item PCoA plots
        \item Alluvial Plots for longitudinal data
        \item Core OTU analysis
